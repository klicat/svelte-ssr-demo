# Svelte SSR Demo

This repository contains the full examples for the Svelte SSR guide [here].

Each folder contains a standalone project for a separate step of the guide.

## 1: Basic SSR

A basic example of using the same Svelte component for client-side and server-side rendering.

## 2: Interactivity

Add interactivity to the component by re-hydrating a server-side rendered component on the client side.

## 3: Typescript and Imports

Add a Rollup configuration to build the server-side component to enable support for `import`ing Javascript modules and the ability to add Typescript.
